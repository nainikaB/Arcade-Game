# Arcade-Game

The game was a project I did as a Udacity student, I received a scholarship for the Front-End Udacity Nanodegree. 
It was one of the projects that was part of degree. 

##  About the game 

The instructions was to recreate a classic arcade game provided with images and starter code a part of that was adding player characters and enemies using javascript objects and prototypes.

## Run the Game

Run locally by downloading, cloning or forking this project:

$ git clone https://github.com/nainikaB/Arcade-Game.git
## How The Game Works
The arrow keys on the keyboard are used to naviagte your player to the water without bumping into the bugs. Every time the player reaches the water and game starts again. If the player hits the bug he looses and the game starts again with an opportunity to play again.
